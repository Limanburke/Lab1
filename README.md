Solution to Problem 8: 
Write a class of functional objects. The operator () returns a random cell of a square board of size n*n cells.
Using this class, find out the following. Let m cells be selected (some of them could be repeated). 
The free zone will be understood as those cells of the board that are not adjacent to the selected ones. 
Using the method of a software experiment, find out the average and median values ​​of the size of the free zone (given n and m)
Using the method of a software experiment, investigate how the size of the free zone depends on the value m/n^2
